# ORCA Arbitrager
This is a project we relase for Solana Hachathon. It captures the 
triangular arbitrage opportunities on a wonderful swap project named Orca.so.

## Overview
Solana is a promising blockchain. It's fast and low cost, which makes a profound difference
in the application scenario.

The features of Solana made possible on-chain high frequency operations 
which are beyond imagination of traditional blockchain system.

## The AB Team
We are a group of experienced devs active in Solana eco-system.

The team has many projects undergoing. We can't release these projects 
since they are under contract with our partners or customers. 

## The Project
Here we are releasing some of our self operating projects, arbitrage bots.

Due to the nature that arbitrage strategy has limited capacity, the strategy we release
is outdated. This project may still run well and make profit. However it's not guaranteed 
to make stable profit for you.

During some test runs weeks before releasing, the bot can make 2%-8% daily yeild trading on Orca
with swap fee taking into consideration. 

It's one of the most naive arbitrage strategy. We believe Solana eco is in its 
preliminary stage since there's still some room for naive arbitrage opportunities.

## Run the project
The purpose of releasing this project is not for running it on your own. 
And here we provide some hints on building and running the project.

### Building
The ORCA-Arb uses Solana web3 api. 

1. Install typescript utilities
2. Compile the dependencies. 
3. Update the user account address defined in `userConsts.js`.
4. Run `orca_sub.js`.
